# vuejs-shoppinglist.io
Shopping list made with Vue.js.
<ul>
<li>You can edit what you added</li>
<li>You can delete what you added</li>
<li>You can delete selected items at once</li>
</ul>
<P>I made it by studying vue.js. I think that there are many places to refactor, such as component parts, but I made something that moves once</p>
